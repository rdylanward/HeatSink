    -   #### Typography
        -   Two fonts were chosen as for the project, Amatic SC and Architects Daughter. Both fonts are handwriting style fonts chosen to give a postcard feel to the site. Sans Serif was chosen as the back-up in the event the main font does not load. Future changes to typography possible.
