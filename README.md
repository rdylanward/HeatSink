<h1 align="center">MS3 Project - HeatSink</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://heatsink-flask-project.herokuapp.com/)

Based on an actual requirement, a company has a series of electric heaters installed in various offices and their canteen. During the colder months, the electric heaters would be left on constantly (in some cases, overnight.), even when they were not needed or the room was too hot. When turning them on in the morning to warm up the area, employees would tend to turn the thermostats to the highest setting and leave them there for the duration. On top of that, when a room would get too hot, rather than turn the thermostat down, employees would tend to open a window and let the cool air in, leaving the heater running at full tilt the entire time. As you may have guessed, this used caused the company to consume unnecessary amounts of electricity.

Being part of the Origin Green initiative coupled with a strong desire to reduce their carbon footprint to zero, the company tasked me to install a system to both control and lessen the usage of the electric heaters. As a cost-saving exercise (translation: being given a minute budget to work with), I elected to install a series of [Raspberry PI Zeros](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) coupled with [Pimoroni Automation Hats](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat) to achieve this goal. As the electric heaters were strategically grouped with multiple heaters wired to the same electrical panels, this allowed me to group multiple heaters on one controller and save 60% on costs compared to commercial HVAC solutions.

At the start, with a bit of education on turning the thermostats down and logically programmed scheduled tasks, all was working well and the heaters were being controlled. However, manipulating the controllers had to be carried out via a series of commands executed via batch files, using command lines. This left the usage of the system awkward, cumbersome, leaving the employees less likely to use the system and reverting to their old ways. A more user-friendly front-end was required to engage the end-user to get the full benefit of the design. This project is the answer to that need. Utilising Python, the Flask Framework, MongoDB, Materialize CSS, HTML5, CSS3 and JQuery, this application gives the end-user an easy to use, easy to access application to control the heaters when desired, as well as administration functionality for the manipulation of devices.

In our modern world, we tend to use our mobile phones for everything. I have designed this application targeting mobile phones. However, with the use of Materialize CSS, the application scales to larger devices (i.e. Tablets, Desktops, etcâ€¦) if a mobile phone is not available.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   I chose red, green and grey accents for the heaters to indicate off, on and disabled states. Off-white was chosen for the background of the heater cards and the sidenav menu.
    -   #### Typography
        -   Montserrat was chosen for its clean design and easy to read style. Sans Serif was chosen as the back-up in the event the main font does not load. Future changes to typography possible.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Implemented a fixed image related to the type of application this is. A dark filter is layered over the image to allow for the elements to stand out.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, iPad & Samsung Note 10+.
-   All menu links were tested across all pages to ensure that they all go to the correct page.
-   All of the buttons were tested, across all pages, to ensure that they go to the links specified or carried out the desired action.

### Known Bugs

-   The initial devices (setup for the company), previously configured, have been deployed and are working. The test device configured identically is not switching the relays. To complete the project, I have configured the heater button to simulate the action of the relay using the database. I have attached the code for the relays [here](https://github.com/rdylanward/HeatSink/blob/master/static/docs/relay.py). The installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rdylanward/HeatSink/blob/master/static/docs/Configure_HeatSink_Automation_Hat.txt).

### Future Development

-   Resolve the issue with the switching the relays on the device and re-implement the remote access.
-   Add a mechanism to create and update schedules on the controllers.
-   Add a documentation page.
